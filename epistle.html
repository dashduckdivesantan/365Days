Congratufuckinlations to us baby, Mans wtffff. You didn’t leave me ke ? You didn’t get tired of me ke ? I didn’t wake up one morning and ghost because I was feeling undervalued ke ? 
I don’t believe it. All those arguments and hours of airing didnt get to any of us ke ? Yeah, we are the GOATs. One year that doesn’t feel like I was checking calendar because it was slow and stressful. One year of feeling love again, 365 days of having someone to check in with.

Looking back, no wait im not looking back , it’s on my palm. Everything we have experienced, I can recite off head. Maybe GCs aren’t so bad afterall because that’s where I found you, maybe Nigeria losing the AFCON wasn’t bad because that was like the first real convo we had, or wait maybe KJV is actually a beasted version of the Bible Or maybe captain whatever you were watching that Saturday is a good show afterall, maybe your WAEC period was more than Obj and theory ?. Maybe, maybe, maybe, too many maybes. You know one thing im sure about though ? My undying love for you. My heart beats for you and only you Dida. You never rushed me to do anything ? Even something as basic as calls. You waited till I was ready, you have a way of waiting for what you want, same way you didn’t give up on me because I was acting nonchalant in the early days of our love? (Or is it friendship). You always made me feel good, I can count how many times you’ve pissed me off in 365 days and it’s not even up to 10. Do you know how crazy that is to me ?
You made me calm to an extent where I have never had the thought of raising my voice at you.
Oh my Dida, you’re a queen and I was not tweaking when I called you my sunshine for the very first time.

I have mad respect for you, “my girlfriend” is not just a mere title since youve held it, it’s peace, love, partnership and joy. You are my favorite person, NOBODY comes closest to. I can never take what you’ve given me for granted.

Adunni mi, thank you for showing me love in a way I never imagined, thank you for restoring partial peace to my life, thank you for being my comforter.

I am proud to call you mine, proud of us, our resilience and proud of you.

I love you so much Dida, NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING and NOBODY on this earth can change that as long as we keep showing up for each other with loyalty and respect .

Dunked on the first year, a lifetime to go
